Versions
========

Finally 0.2.0 is out, and if you are using 0.1.47 or bellow, you must CHANGE the way you register you views.

It's very simple, change this::

	baseapp = BaseApp(app)
	baseapp.add_view(GroupGeneralView, "List Groups","/groups/list","th-large","Contacts")
	baseapp.add_view(PersonGeneralView, "List Contacts","/persons/list","earphone","Contacts")
	baseapp.add_view(PersonChartView, "Contacts Chart","/persons/chart","earphone","Contacts")
	
To this::

	baseapp = BaseApp(app)
	baseapp.add_view(GroupGeneralView(), "List Groups","/groups/list","th-large","Contacts")
	baseapp.add_view(PersonGeneralView(), "List Contacts","/persons/list","earphone","Contacts")
	baseapp.add_view(PersonChartView(), "Contacts Chart","/persons/chart","earphone","Contacts")

Small change you just have to instantiate your classes.
